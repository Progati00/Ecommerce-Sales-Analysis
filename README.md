# Ecommerce Sales Analysis

## What I Did
- Created an `Ecommerce` database and imported the sales dataset.  
- Explored the dataset to understand its structure and key fields.  
- Extracted year and month from the `Order_Date` column for time-based analysis.  
- Calculated the total revenue for all orders.  
- Analyzed monthly revenue and ranked months by performance.  
- Counted the number of orders per month for each year to track order volume trends.  
- Computed total sales, total quantity sold, and average profit across all orders.  
- Evaluated payment methods by total sales, average discount, number of products sold, shipping costs, and customer count.  
- Summarized findings to identify trends, peak sales periods, and top-performing payment methods.
